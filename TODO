- PartialAPICalls have a __call__ method that just does a get
- curry() accepts optional arguments which are curried later:
  fun = g.url.partial.get(*args, **kwargs);fun(*moreargs) or something
- Implement 'Partial' Urls that can be added together, or pre/appended
  to a regular one. (At that point, rename PartialAPICalls to something
  less confusing.)
- Add patch/delete support, etc.
- More robust header handling. Some things don't quite work.
