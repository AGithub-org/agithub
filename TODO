- RequestBuilder objects need a __call__ method that just does a head
- curry() accepts optional arguments which are curried later:
  fun = g.url.partial.get(*args, **kwargs);fun(*moreargs) or something
- Implement 'Partial' Urls that can be added together, or pre/appended
  to a regular one.

* Support request/response compression

- XML support
